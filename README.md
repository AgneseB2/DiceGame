# DiceGame
This is a simple Dice Game i created with html,css and js .

I have just started with html , css and js and built this simple project that generates a random number bewteen 1-6 and corresponding to that , displays the appropriate dice number to the user . It also displays the addition of all the scores .

I know the code is not that much clean and the design too may not be appropriate , though i just tried it .
